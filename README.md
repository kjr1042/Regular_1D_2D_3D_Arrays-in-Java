# Regular_1D_2D_3D_Arrays-in-Java
This repository provides Java examples showcasing the usage of regular arrays, including 1D, 2D, and 3D arrays. If you're a beginner learning about arrays these examples cover a range of scenarios.

## Introduction

Arrays are fundamental data structures in Java, and understanding their use is crucial for efficient programming. This repository organizes examples into three categories:
1. 1D Arrays
2. 2D Arrays
3. 3D Arrays

Each category is represented in its own directory with relevant Java files containing sample code and explanations.

## Arrays Included

### 1. 1D Arrays
- **Description**: Examples demonstrating the creation, manipulation, and traversal of 1D arrays.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  `int a[] =new int[5];`

### 2. 2D Arrays
- **Description**: Examples showcasing the usage of 2D arrays, often used for matrices or grids.
- **Example**:
  ```java
   `int a[][]=new int [2][5];`

### 3. 3D Arrays
- **Description**: Examples illustrating the creation and manipulation of 3D arrays.
- **Example**:
   ```java
  `int a[][][]=new int [2][3][5];`
